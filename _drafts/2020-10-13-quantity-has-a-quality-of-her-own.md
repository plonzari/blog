By talking to a few hundred senators <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthago_delenda_est" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthago_delenda_est">Cicero was able to start a war</a>. Luther has done it by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-five_Theses" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-five_Theses">nailing a piece of paper to a door</a> and Hearst <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_of_the_Spanish%E2%80%93American_War" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_of_the_Spanish%E2%80%93American_War">with a journal</a> with maybe 100000 readers. Radio and television have been considered big revolutions in opinion forming. It is, therefore, reasonable to wonder if the changes caused by social media are something new, different from the past. I would suggest that the more or less gradual capacity of information dissemination and opinion-forming does not mean that the present is not qualitatively different.

There are many models for opinion-forming (rumor-spreading) but the one I like most is based on the well-known Ising model. See for example _<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-767.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-767.pdf">Ising model of rumour spreading in interacting communities</a>_, by Ostili et al. The model is simple: the final state of a population choosing between two opinions ($ latex \large O=1$ and $ latex \large O=1$) is decided by minimizing an energy function

$ latex \large E=\sum\_i \sum\_{j\in N\_i} O\_i O_j$
