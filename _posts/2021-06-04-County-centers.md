For those lacking visit destinations I have a map with geographical centers of each romanian county.
For the moment only latitude and longitude to be checked in Google Maps.
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/44%C2%B026'18.4%22N+26%C2%B005'30.1%22E/@44.43844,26.0895003,899m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d44.43844!4d26.091689 
"> Google Maps. </a>

{% include rocenters.html %}

For example the center of Bucharest seems to be in Cismigiu Park, on Aleea Sipotul Fantanilor.
