Have you ever felt that people change vocal timbre and tone when changing language? 
If you are like me, you have also gotten sometimes annoyed because people seem
to get warmer when changing to their native language or logical and assertive when 
speaking in their second language. After listening to the course 
<a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/Language-and-the-Mind-Audiobook/1629978701"> 
 <em>Language and the Mind</em> </a> (chapter 23 on bilingualism) I learned that
similar phenomena have been documented by several noted researchers and used as 
useful tools to further explore the intimate link between language and the mind.

The audiobook itself is full of intriguing ideas. Being a course it is quite 
difficult to follow and remember all the arguments without serious revisions and 
careful reading of extra materials after each session (chapter). Nevertheless,
it could be a good compendium from which one can get an overall feeling about 
the subject and a starting point for more research into particularly catching 
concepts.

The author does a good job of presenting the different arguments and 
interpretations when there is no consensus in the community. The teacher,
Spencer Kelly, is a professor of psychology and neurosciences, and he offers a 
scientific approach always citing scientific studies. Most of the time though it 
is difficult to estimate the strength of different arguments. For example, 
my feeling is that most studies in the field are plagued by methodological flaws 
and reproducibility failures. Therefore, it is important to know for each study 
of interest  its statistical power. More importantly, has anyone tried to
replicate it and/or has the replication has been successful?

About bilingualism, I have always assumed that emotion is quite difficult to 
express in a second language, and it comes easier in the native language. Also, 
intelligent and proficient speakers of a second language make  painstaking 
efforts to mimic native speakers and use the correct grammar, vocabulary and 
intonations. This would explain my observations, but many studies, as those by 
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22517192/"> 
 <em>Boaz Keysar</em> </a> and 
<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-morality-changes-in-a-foreign-language/"> 
 <em>Albert Costa</em> </a>, cited in the course, suggest that bilingualism
can transform the brain. Ethics, logics and emotion can be markedly different
in a second language. I was definitely wrong being annoyed.
