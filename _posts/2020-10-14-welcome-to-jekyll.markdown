...

went down to the beach (to play one day)

<!--more-->

and maggie discovered a shell that sang  
so sweetly she couldn't remember her troubles,and 

milly befriended a stranded star  
whose rays five languid fingers were;

and molly was chased by a horrible thing  
which raced sideways while blowing bubbles:and 

may came home with a smooth round stone  
as small as a world and as large as alone.

For whatever we lose(like a you or a me)  
it's always ourselves we find in the sea
