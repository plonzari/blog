  Some <em>Fermi </em>estimates of population structure suggest that 2020 is a turning point in Romanian politics.
</p>

Developed countries boast less than 1% mortality per year and more than  80 years of life expectancy. 
For the 2M Romanians, one can estimate  250K people for each age slice. 
This also means that there are 4.5M minors and 7.5M people born after the 1989 revolution.
 
Taking into account the demographic decline of the last years let us assume that there are 16M voters in Romania. 
Also, the median age of voters falls around 50. As a consequnce about half of the voters have been educated 
(finished school) before the 1989 revolution. This is consistent with the approximation that only Romanians 
born after 1972 have had had some democratic education.

In the past elections, the education level has been an important determinant of people's choices. 
I would also argue that the election results and political life has seen major changes in the past few years. 
Given that I would expect the proportion of higher education people to be around 25% while 10-20% do not finish middle 
school my conclusion is that it is mostly the quality of education that determines Romanian's majority choice. 

While a more detailed analysis is necessary let us hope that, with more than half of voters educated in democracy, 
we are finally turning the page. 30 years has been long enough!
