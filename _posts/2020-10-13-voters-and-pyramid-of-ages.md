  Some <em>Fermi </em>estimates of population structure suggest that 2020 is a turning point in Romanian politics.
</p>

Consistent with about 1% mortality per year and around 80 years of life expectancy for the 2M Romanians, one can estimate 250K people for each age slice. We can estimate therefore that there are 4.5M minors and 7.5M people born after the 1989 revolution. 

Taking into account the demographic decline of the last years let us assume that there are 16M voters in Romania. The median age of voters falls around 50 and as a consequence about half of the voters have been educated (finished school) before the 1989 revolution. This is consistent with the approximation that only Romanians born after 1972 have had had some &#8220;democratic&#8221; education.

In the past elections, the education level has been an important determinant of people&#8217;s choices. I would also argue that the election results and political life has seen major changes in the past few years. Given that I would expect the proportion of higher education people to be around 25% while 10-20% do not finish middle school my conclusion is that it is mostly the quality of education that determines Romanian&#8217;s majority choice. 

While a more detailed analysis is necessary let us hope that, with more than half of voters educated in democracy, we are finally turning the page. 30 years has been long enough!
