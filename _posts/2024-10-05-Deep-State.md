Wikipedia tells us that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_state"> 
__Deep state__ is a calque of the Turkish words derin devlet. </a> 
While this notion has value, it has been appropriated by noxious political groups and its 
connotations have many subtle but important differences, depending on the context.

### The deep state is a genuine danger

As I understand it Turkyie's history is a good example for the structural challenges of 
democracy for which the explicit and visible separation of powers is an absolute requirement.
Unfortunately the founder(s) of Turkish Republic have given the army a task beyond protecting 
the country: safeguarding the governing system, especially its secularism. I'm quite sure 
the founder(s) had good intentions, and similar extensions of the military's role is 
often made without malice in many genuine democracies.

Because of this, the military, together with a shadowy coalition of civilian interests 
(the __derin devlet__), have toppled elected governments four times while undermining the 
democratic process countless other times. The good intentions have naturally evolved into 
a cabal and the public reaction has been to put in power an equally harmful one.

### What is the deep state

In the US, the UK, and many other countries the deep state is lately the name used by populist 
politicians to describe establishment figures, most often carrier administrators, 
obstructing their latest reckless schemes. However, it can also refer to the well-known 
"military-industrial complex" which national priorities. So are there 
commonalities between the different forms of deep state?

Almost by definition the main actors behind the deep state are unelected, far from the public 
scrutiny, secret. The security apparatus both visible (the military, police) and invisible 
("intelligence" services) is always, in some form, part of the deep state.

### Romania

What characterizes the Romanian candidates for the title of deep state actor is first and 
foremost incompetence. There is definitely a network initially organized around the former
communist __Securitatea__ employees that have made the transition to the new democratic 
institution. Nowadays, it seems that the network is centered around the graduates of the 
corrupt security higher education institution (spy, military and police academies). 
Additionally, as there is no 
genuine school of public administration in Romania, many politicians pursue some form of 
graduate and post-graduate programs at those institutions.

Given the numerous scandals regarding involving fake diplomas and 
questionable credentials of professors at those schools, it is clear that little useful
knowledge is imparted there. Most likely attending one of the 
"academies" is merely an opportunity to build networks (along with a disdain for
the rule of law) that will serve them well in the positions they occupy after graduation, 
with maximum incompetence. 

### Conclusions

The first conclusion is that good governance is dynamic. There is no single best, stable solution,
and the good choice has to be continuously tweaked. Any law or institution will eventually 
degrade and nearly all principles will require periodic reinterpretations. Only the constant 
vigilance of all the members of society can protect us from catastrophes like totalitarianism 
or war.

Regarding the Romanian situation, the deep state is mostly about small-minded people 
banding together to hide their incompetence. One should not forget Hanlon's Razor: 

"Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity."
