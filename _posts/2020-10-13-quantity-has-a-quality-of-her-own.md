By talking to a few hundred senators 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthago_delenda_est" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthago_delenda_est">Cicero was able to start a war</a>. Luther has done it by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-five_Theses" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-five_Theses">nailing a piece of paper to a door</a> 
and Hearst <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_of_the_Spanish%E2%80%93American_War" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_of_the_Spanish%E2%80%93American_War">with a journal</a> 
with maybe 100000 readers. Radio and television have been considered big revolutions in opinion forming. 
It is, therefore, reasonable to wonder if the changes caused by social media are something new, different from 
the past. I would suggest that the more or less gradual capacity of information dissemination and opinion-forming 
does not mean that the present is not qualitatively different.

There are many models for opinion-forming (rumor-spreading) but the one I like most is based on the well-known 
Ising model. See for example 
<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-767.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-767.pdf">Ising model of rumour spreading in interacting communities</a>, 
by Ostili et al. The model is simple: the final state of a population choosing between two opinions 
$$  O=1 $$ and $$O=-1$$ is decided by minimizing an energy function

$$  E=-J \sum_i \sum_{j\in N_i} O_i O_j $$

This formula models a tendency of communicating people to adopt similar opinions.
If the neighbourhood of $$N_i$$ is small the population contains many small communities of like opinion. But beyond a 
certain size of neighborhoods one can have situations in which only there is a small number of communities and everyone 
in the community has the same opinion. Moreover the transition can be sudden.

A conclusion of such an analysis would be that, assuming the community size has increased constantly in the past, 
it is possible that the opinion forming dynamics have changes drastically at a certain point in time, probably quite 
recently. At this point many measurable variables could be drastically altered. For example the average number of
people one knows (talks to) having a different opinion would drop to zero. We do not really know if this is the case
and it is difficult to go back in time and measure.

A similar physically inspired model of social dynamics is beautifully presented as a
