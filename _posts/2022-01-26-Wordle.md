In the past months the Twitter has been overtaken by stacks of colored boxes. It is the fault of a new words-game:   
<a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/"> WORDLE </a>. Free and with a minimalistic design the game has 
received a well deserved attention, particularly compared to its simplicity.

Each day a five letters word is proposed and you have six tries to guess it. For each guess the letters that in your guess which 
can be found in the solution are highlighted (orange for letters found in the same position and blue if not).

By now one can find quite a few articles discussing winning strategies and even web apps offering word suggestions 
for  the game. Given the apparent simplicity of the game I want a more exact answer to simple questions: can the game 
be solved for any proposed solution word? which is the best starting word. For the moment I have no answers.

Let us start with properly setting up the game. One starts with a list (L) of possible guesses. For the original game
this list contains 12972 five letters words, some of them quite obscure. The solutions are chosen from a smaller 
sublist list (A) of 2315 more common words. We suppose the choice to be uniformly random.

The game is defined by a tree where each node is a possible color configuration. The children of each node are the 
color configurations that can be obtained by adding another guess, for each possible guess and each possible 
solution compatible with the node. Let us suppose that we start with the word TRACE and the solution is either 
BELIE or BIBLE. A portion of the game tree would look like this:
