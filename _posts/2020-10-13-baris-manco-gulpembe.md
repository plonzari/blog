Seen in Turkish series 
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7146600/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7146600/">Boru</a> 
from Netflix. Awful series but learned about 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolian_rock" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolian_rock">Anadolu rock</a>.
It seems to me that there are indeed good ways to combine eastern (turkish?) rhythms and modern arrangements to replace 
the awful so called music produced in Romania and Bulgaria.
