As far as I understand the numbers for the phase III trials for Covid-19 vaccines  can be interpreted as follows.

<!--more-->

If there are $$N_1$$ voluntaries receiving a vaccine and $$N_2$$ voluntaries receiving a placebo, and, at a certain 
point in time, $$V_1$$ and $$V_2$$ voluntaries infected with Sars-Cov-2, one can infer attack rates as
$$p_i=\frac{V_i}{N_i}$$. In the end the vaccine efficacy is 

$$V_e=1-\frac{p_1}{p_2}$$

For the Moderna vaccine the numbers seem 
<a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/16/modernas-covid-19-vaccine-is-strongly-effective-early-look-at-data-show"> 
 <em>to be</em> </a>
  $$N_1=N_2=15000$$ $$V_1=5$$ and $$V_2=90$$, which gives $$V_e=.94$$.
 
 
 What bothers me are the very low numbers of infected, which makes me think that the efficacy can be 
 significantly different. Indeed, the real infection rates $$p_i$$ could be very different from the estimate 
 above. Small $$V_i$$ can imply quite big uncertainties.
 
 Let us consider the probability $$P(p_i|N_i,V_i)$$, of having a certain infection rate, given that there are
 $$V_i$$ infected in a population of $$N_i$$ individuals. It could be estimated under the assumption of independent 
 infections. I would like to find a lower bound $$V_l$$ such that the probability  that $$V_e$$ is even lower
 than $$V_l$$, is small (1%).
 
 We need to solve the equation:
 
 $$\int_0^1 dp_1 dp_2 P(p_1 | N_1,V_1)P(p_2 | N_2,V_2)  \theta(1-\frac{p_1}{p_2}-V_l)=.001.$$
 
 Using a  very simple model with flat prior one can derive a formula very similar to the 
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution"> 
 <em>binomial distribution:</em> </a>
 $$P(p_i |  N_i,V_i)=K_i(N_i,V_i) p_i^{V_i}(1-p_i)^{N_i-V_i} $$ where $$K_i$$ is the  appropriate 
 normalization constraint. The integral above formalizes the sum of all the probabilities of 
 possible infection rates, with and without vaccine, 
 that  are compatible with the numbers obtained in the trial and which give an efficacy lower than a certain 
 threshold. As it turns out the Moderna vaccine has an efficacy of more than 85% with 99% probability and and
 an efficacy higher than 80.5% with 99.9% probability. The numbers have been estimated with

 depend on $$N_i$$.

 The Pfizer vaccine has $$V_1=8$$ and $$V_2=162$$ which gives $$V_e=.95$$ while the lower limits are 89% and 
 86.5% for 99% and 99.9% 
 probability. The AstraZeneca one has $$V_1=30$$ and $$V_2=101$$ for a $$V_e=.7$$, and even lower bounds.
 With 99% probability the efficacy must better than 54% but for a 99.9% probability one has to lower the limit to 47%.
 I have assumed that the test subjects are equally divided in the vaccinated and control groups.
 
 If I understand correctly this vaccine efficacy can be related to the famous herd immunity concept. Indeed,
 if one individual infects $$R$$ others, with vaccine this number  would be $$(1-V_e)*R$$. The virus will only
 propagate if $$V_e<1-\frac{1}{R}$$. Therefore $$V_e$$ has to be better than the proportion of infected population 
 needed for "herd immunity" in the absence of a vaccine. With $$R$$ between 3 and 5, $$V_e$$ needs to be bigger 
 than 80%. Both Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are enough (with high probability) while the Oxford vaccine has 
 between 5% and 75% probability to require additional measures to curb the pandemic.
