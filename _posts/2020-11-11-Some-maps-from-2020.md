Upon discovering some data stores pertaining to the 2020 American presidential elections I could not resist playing 
with the data and with python visualization tools.

The gains of the democrats between the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections. The differences in percent votes are 
stretched with a sigmoid for  better contrast:

It seems that the democrats have lost votes in Upstate New York, along the Texas-Mexico border and along the 
Mississippi river south of Memphis. In Texas it is probably the hispanic population which has not been convinced.

The percentage of population which is of hispanic origins:

This seems to be similar with the joke of two Hungarians crossing the river Olt.



Also some black voters in Arkansas and Mississippi seem less convinced by Biden. 

The percentage of population which is of african-american origins:
