Recently I saw the new <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-400/?resellerType=home"> 
Raspberry Pi 400 </a> personal computer and wondered how could be used on a large(ish) scale in education.

The package sells for 70$ and is basically an 1.8GHz Cortex processor with 4GB RAM running Linux. 
Adding a 32GB MicroSD card and a cheap 80$  monitor we could have a desktop computer for  160$. 
This could be compared with the 150$ (10", 3GB ram, 32GB disk) tablets given by the Romanian government to every student.

I propose donating one Raspberry Pi computer to every student starting middle-school. Such an initiative 
would provide a powerful boost to the level of much needed computer literacy. First the price. In Romania I estimate 
about 250K students per age bracket. This adds up to 40M dollars for the hardware. Or about 300M if every student 
starting from middle school gets one, sum to be spent over 8 years. This sum can be compared with slightly more than 
9B dollars the total budget allocated to education (and research) by the Romanian government. Or the 3.5B actually 
directed to schools and students each year.

The hardware should be supplemented with online courses. A good course would need maybe 10 man hours. Maybe 200 courses 
per year would be needed to engage the students. At 15 dollars per hour this would cost 30K, but if one extends the 
program to 8 years 250K would be needed. As an aside, creating a full online curriculum would require on the 
order of 10K courses. This is based on about 30 hours per week for 35 weeks of school, minus the hours used for other 
activities. This is <em> only </em> 1.5M, and it could actually be a better starting point for our initiative, 
especially in the context of the pandemic.

Going back to the usefulness of the program my take is that this way the students will be  provided 
with  a hands on approach to computer literacy. I am convinced that rudiments of programming are essential for every
study path given the impact computers and algorithms have on everyone's life. Moreover courses could cover multiple
different topics as logic, image and video processing or writing and information analysis.

It was suggested to me it would be a good idea to induce established content creators to produce courses in the program,
maybe in a competitive framework. It would be fun to establish collaborations between educators and 
<em> influencers. </em> The budget for a course should include specific parts for creating the material 
(following a program) and actual creation of the course (graphics and video). 
Most important would be keeping the interest of the students over the years. Online olympiads? Separate budget for yearly
prizes consisting in upgrades of memory, monitors and/or base system?

Adding specialization programs for teachers, special programs for students, help with internet connections and
 running costs we should reach the 50M dollars budget. This is a lot for a charitable organization but could be financed 
 with a third of the 150M in revenues per year of the Romanian Orthodox Church. Over ten years it will cost about as 
 much as the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Salvation_Cathedral"> 
People's Salvation Cathedral </a> while definitely much more useful.
