I"u<p>For the past few months I have had a love-hate relationship with the rationalist movement. Their capacity to produce
extremely insightful analyses on very diverse subjects is particularly exciting. But I am bothered by their hubris. 
It is clear that they have the capacity to accumulate, assimilate and analyze new ideas. But I am not convinced that 
“reason <em>can be</em> the only source of knowledge”. As it is impossible for one person to completely understand most facets 
of most problems, a healthy dose of (reasoned) trust is necessary. Also, I am bored by their fascination with the AI alignment 
problem.</p>
