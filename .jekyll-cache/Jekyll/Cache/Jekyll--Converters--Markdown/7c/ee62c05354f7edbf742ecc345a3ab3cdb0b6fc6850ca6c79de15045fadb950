I"^<p>I often use the average ratings of books/movies from Goodreads/IMDB in order to decide what to read/watch next. 
Unfortunately, if there are not enough ratings the average rating is often inflated and it seems to decrease
with the number of ratings. Plots of two datasets of books and movies show that the story is slightly more complicated.</p>
