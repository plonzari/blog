I"Æ<p>In the past few months I have been seen more and more examples of virulent racist, sexist and anti-LGBTQ reactions in 
the Romanian press. My unpleasant surprise was to find such attitudes in a part of the Romanian society  which I 
thought shared my ideas on politics and society. One can find many educated, well-paid, westward-looking young 
people showing a profound misunderstanding concerning the problems of minorities (of all kinds). 
It is really sad to read on channels I used to trust climato-sceptic, anti-feminist and anti-‚Äúcancel-culture‚Äù articles,
 or to hear that people I thought to be the future of Romania expressing homophobic or anti-vaccination ideas.</p>
