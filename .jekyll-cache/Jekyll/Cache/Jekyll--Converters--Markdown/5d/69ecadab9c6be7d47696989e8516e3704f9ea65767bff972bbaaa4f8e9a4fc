I"Z<p>After a few months of more or less diligent study I finished “consulting” three great resources for
learning about algorithms: <a href="https://www.algorithmsilluminated.org/"> 
 Algorithms Illuminated book series by Tim Roughgarden,</a> 
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844"> 
 Introduction to Algorithms, by Corben et al.</a> and 
<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs168/index.html"> 
 the Stanford course CS 168: The Modern Algorithmic Toolbox.</a> I was not diligent enough to do the homeworks and solve
all the proposed problems but I followed all the arguments and most proofs.</p>

<p>The most important thing one learns from such resources is how and where to look for a good algorithm if the need 
arises. But for me the most surprising thing  have been the <em>data structures</em>.</p>
