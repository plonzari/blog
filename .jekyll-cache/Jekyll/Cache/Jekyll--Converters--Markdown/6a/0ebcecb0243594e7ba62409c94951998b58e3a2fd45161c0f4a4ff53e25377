I"ˆ<p>Since last week some verses are rattling around in my head. Initially I felt that they did not 
properly honor the resistance of the Ukrainians. Today, reading some refugeesâ€™ testimonials,
I am convinced that these words are still relevant, even after more than 100 years.</p>

<p>Bent double, like old beggars under sacks,<br />
Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,<br />
Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs,<br />
And towards our distant rest began to trudge.<br />
<!--more-->
Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots,<br />
But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind;<br />
Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots<br />
Of gas-shells dropping softly behind.</p>

<p>Gas! GAS! Quick, boys!â€”An ecstasy of fumbling<br />
Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time,<br />
But someone still was yelling out and stumbling<br />
And floundâ€™ring like a man in fire or lime.â€”<br />
Dim through the misty panes and thick green light,<br />
As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.</p>

<p>In all my dreams before my helpless sight,<br />
He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.</p>

<p>If in some smothering dreams, you too could pace<br />
Behind the wagon that we flung him in,<br />
And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,<br />
His hanging face, like a devilâ€™s sick of sin;<br />
If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood<br />
Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,<br />
Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud<br />
Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,â€”<br />
My friend, you would not tell with such high zest<br />
To children ardent for some desperate glory,<br />
The old Lie:

Pro patria mori.</a></p>
