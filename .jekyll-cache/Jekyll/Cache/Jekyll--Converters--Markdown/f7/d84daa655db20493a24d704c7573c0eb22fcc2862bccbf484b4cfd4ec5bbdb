<p>went down to the beach (to play one day)</p>

<!--more-->

<p>and maggie discovered a shell that sang<br />
so sweetly she couldn’t remember her troubles,and</p>

<p>milly befriended a stranded star<br />
whose rays five languid fingers were;</p>

<p>and molly was chased by a horrible thing<br />
which raced sideways while blowing bubbles:and</p>

<p>may came home with a smooth round stone<br />
as small as a world and as large as alone.</p>

<p>For whatever we lose(like a you or a me)<br />
it’s always ourselves we find in the sea</p>
