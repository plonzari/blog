I"ù<p>Since last week some verses are rattling around in my head. Initially I felt that they did not 
properly honor the resistance of the Ukrainians. Today, reading some refugeesâ€™ testimonials,
I am convinced that these words are still relevant, even after more than 100 years.</p>

<p>Bent double, like old beggars under sacks,<br />
Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,<br />
Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs,<br />
And towards our distant rest began to trudge.</p>
