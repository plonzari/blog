I"È<p>For some time I have accepted that each of us is somehow trapped inside a (filter) bubble, an echo 
chamber that reflects over and over our own opinions. The same happens for everyone else and their 
opinions become as distorted and far from reality as ours. There is here a dangerous relativism, 
because, even if there are bubbles and echo cambers, some of them can still be mainly truthful 
representations of the world and others simply wrong.</p>
