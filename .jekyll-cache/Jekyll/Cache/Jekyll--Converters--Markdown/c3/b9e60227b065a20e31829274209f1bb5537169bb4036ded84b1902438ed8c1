 Some people</a> argue that most <em>easy</em> great ideas have been <em>plucked</em> already and great discoveries 
are more and more difficult to come by. My take on this is that over the past century there has been a 
decreasing number of marketable innovations. These days is very difficult to sell ideas and one usually
needs to buy - hire the person/team that holds the IP. I recently found a <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27787/w27787.pdf"> 
 paper</a> that formalizes this idea using the concept of <em>knowledge burden</em>.</p>
