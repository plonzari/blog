<p>One should definitely visit the Scrovegni Chapel if in Padua
but this has to be planned in advance. In this case <em>mint coffee</em> and <em>zabaione</em>
at <a href="https://www.caffepedrocchi.it/en/"> Caffe Pedrocchi </a> (a local institution) 
is much more than a consolation prize.</p>

<h4 id="bologna">Bologna</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Tagliatelle al Ragu: Of course, we couldn’t pass through Bologna, known for its culinary heritage, without indulging in the iconic tagliatelle al ragu (what everyone else calls bolognese sauce). It’s like a warm hug from an Italian nonna.</li>
  <li>Leaning Towers: As we strolled through the city, we couldn’t help but notice Bologna’s leaning towers, one of them apparently even more inclined than the famous Pisa Tower. It seemed like Bologna was trying to out-lean Pisa in a friendly rivalry of tilting towers.</li>
