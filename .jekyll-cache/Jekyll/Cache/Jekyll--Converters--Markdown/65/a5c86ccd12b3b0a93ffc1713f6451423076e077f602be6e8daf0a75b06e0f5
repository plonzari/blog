      <td>Preemptive concurrency. Due to GIL not real multitasking (parallelism). Same memory context. Like coroutines good only for non-blocking I/O (network or disk) or external function calls.</td>

      <td>kernel threads</td>
      <td>A full interpreter with a separate GIL. Capable of true multitasking. Communicates through serialized (pickle) messages (objects). In principle capable to access shared memory. Very new, maybe preparing a no-GIL future.</td>

<p>As a comparison <em>virtual threads</em> for Java are the equivalent of coroutines in Java. They allow for low memory, 
fast to spin-up  <em>preemptive</em> multitasking. They are transparently assigned by JVM to pre-spun kernel threads.</p>
