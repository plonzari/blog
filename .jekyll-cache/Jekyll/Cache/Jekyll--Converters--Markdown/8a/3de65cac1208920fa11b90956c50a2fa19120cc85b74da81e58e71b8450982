<p>Few days ago TESLA <a href="https://livestream.tesla.com/"> introduced </a> their humanoid robot, Optimus. 
One question I thought about some regarding the bot is [why humanoid?]. And one answer could be the ability to 
learn by observing.</p>

<p>The history of technology in general, and more recently robotics and machine learning has shown that the best 
technical solutions do not imitate biology. Systems designed for specific tasks are much easier to optimize and
easily reach performance levels superior to comparable biological solutions. Thus, a humanoid robot would be 
suboptimal on any individual task.</p>

<p>Initially I thought that versatility would provide the biggest advantage for such a form. But it is far from 
obvious why a spider-like robot would be less versatile. Another possibility is that a humanoid robot can be better 
used in spaces and with tools already designed for humans. This would mean that a humanoid form is just the first 
step in the evolution of the independent robot.</p>

<p>My thinking is that a humanoid form will also provide a big advantage for the training of the robot. Training AI‚Äôs
for object detection, for example, is normally done starting from datasets of recorded images. Surprisingly 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00660"> ‚Äúmobile‚Äù embodied AI agents</a> seem to be superior to their static 
counterparts. In general one could very well understand that ‚Äúlearning by doing‚Äù would be a better strategy, but 
still, not an argument for a humanoid form.</p>

<p>Yann LeCun, AI chief at Meta, has published a 
<a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=BZ5a1r-kVsf"> paper</a> a few months ago 
laying out his  vision for ‚Äúautonomous‚Äù AIs that can learn and experience the world as animals and humans.
The paper is very dense, and I could not follow it in detail, but one point that struck me the fact that animals 
seem to learn much more from observation than for doing.</p>

The tribulations of artificial systems typically trained using reinforcement learning, do not look like learning
in animals.
